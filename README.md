# HP AI Studio

## Overview

HP AI Studio is a powerful platform designed for building and deploying machine learning and AI models. It offers a robust environment for AI creation, research, experimentation, and prototyping. With HP AI Studio, users can create customized workspaces, containerize tools, and ensure consistency across development environments.

## Key Features

- **AI Creation**: For creators developing and researching AI models.
- **AI Development**: For developers working on AI projects and transferring learning.
- **AI Usage**: For users applying AI models for inference and other tasks.

## Benefits

- **Standardization**: Simplify and standardize the use of GPUs and local compute resources, making it easier to manage multiple devices.
- **Centralized Management**: Keep all data, teammates, notebooks, metrics, and artifacts in one place to avoid rework and streamline processes.
- **Project Metadata**: Share project metadata to ensure containers can be rebuilt on different machines, with synchronization to GitHub for code management.
- **Accelerated Development**: Speed up local model development with a consistent and efficient environment.

## Getting Started

1. **Install HP AI Studio**: Follow the [Installation and Setup](installation.md) guide to get HP AI Studio up and running.
2. **Create a Workspace**: Set up a customized workspace for your projects.
3. **Containerize Tools**: Learn how to containerize your tools and environments to ensure consistency.
4. **Manage Projects**: Use the platform to manage project metadata, sync with GitHub, and avoid rework.
